"""PDF lane shared by every web provider.

Detects PDF URLs, downloads them through the SSRF gate, and extracts text
with pymupdf. This used to live inside the crawl4ai provider only, so a
vault on the builtin provider had no PDF handling at all: a direct .pdf
link was decoded as HTML text and rejected by the junk gate as "Binary PDF
garbage in content", identically for every mirror of the same document,
and an arXiv /abs/ link saved the abstract page instead of the paper (#82).

Every failure path here produces a reason string. Providers carry that
reason on the fallback result's ``metadata["pdf_failure"]`` so the CLI can
print it next to the junk verdict instead of a bare generic message.
