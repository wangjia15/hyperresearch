"""SSRF-safe HTTP helper for outbound fetches.

Centralizes the network egress used by web providers and the image
downloader. Every request:

- Validates the URL scheme (http/https only).
- Resolves the hostname and refuses any address that is private,
  loopback, link-local, multicast, reserved, or unspecified — so an
  attacker page cannot trick a fetcher into reaching `169.254.169.254`
  (cloud metadata), `127.0.0.1`, RFC1918, or `file://`.
- Follows redirects MANUALLY, re-validating each hop against the same
  gate.
- Streams the response into a fixed-size buffer so a hostile server
  cannot exhaust memory with an infinite or zip-bombed body.

The address check is BEST-EFFORT against DNS rebinding: the gate
resolves the hostname to validate it, but httpx re-resolves at connect
time, so a low-TTL record that flips between the two lookups can still
reach a private address. Closing that window needs the validated IP
pinned into the actual connection, which httpx does not support without
a custom transport; the residual risk is accepted and documented here.

Returns a small :class:`SafeResponse` dataclass instead of an
``httpx.Response`` so callers don't depend on httpx internals.
