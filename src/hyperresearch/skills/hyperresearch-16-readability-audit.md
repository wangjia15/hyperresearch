description: >
  Step 16 (final) of the hyperresearch V8 pipeline. Spawns the
  hyperresearch-readability-recommender subagent (Read+Write
  tool-locked) to audit the polished final report and write JSON
  recommendations for paragraph merges, breaks, list/table conversions,
  bold injection, sentence splits, and HR removal. The orchestrator
  reads the recommendations and SELECTIVELY applies them via direct
  Edit calls (the recommender does NOT modify the report itself).
  Logs orchestrator decisions to a separate file. Runs for ALL tiers.
  Invoked via Skill tool from the entry skill.

# Step 16 — Readability audit & selective apply (FINAL STEP)

**Tier gate:** Runs for ALL tiers. Every report gets a readability audit, regardless of tier — readability is the dimension where small structural changes (paragraph rhythm, list/table conversions, bold injection) yield outsized scoring gains.

**Goal:** improve the report's visual structure, paragraph rhythm, and scannability without changing substantive content. The recommender writes a JSON list of suggested changes; YOU (the orchestrator) decide which to apply.

**Why split recommender + orchestrator-applied:** an Edit-based reformatter (V7-style) sometimes makes changes that hurt the argument — converting a flowing paragraph to a bullet list when the prose was load-bearing, or merging paragraphs that addressed distinct sub-topics. By having the recommender produce JSON suggestions and the orchestrator decide what to apply, we get the recommender's pattern-matching speed plus your judgment about which changes serve the research_query.

## Recover state

Read these inputs:
- `research/runs/<vault_tag>/scaffold.md` — vault_tag
- `research/notes/final_report_<vault_tag>.md` — the polished final report from step 15

---

## Step 16.1 — Spawn the readability recommender

Spawn ONE `hyperresearch-readability-recommender` subagent. Single spawn, runs once.

**Spawn template:**
```
<< h.spawn_key >>: hyperresearch-readability-recommender
prompt: |
  RESEARCH QUERY (verbatim, gospel):
  > {{paste research/runs/<vault_tag>/query.md body}}

  QUERY FILE: research/runs/<vault_tag>/query.md

  PIPELINE POSITION: You are step 16 of the hyperresearch V8 pipeline —
  the final analytical pass. The final report at
  research/notes/final_report_<vault_tag>.md has been drafted (step 10),
  synthesized (step 11), critiqued (step 12), gap-filled (step 13),
  patched (step 14), and polish-audited (step 15). Your job: write
  JSON recommendations for paragraph rhythm, list/table conversions,
  and other structural readability improvements. You are tool-locked
  to [Read, Write] — you cannot Edit the report. The orchestrator
  reads your recommendations and decides which to apply.

  YOUR INPUTS:
  - draft_path: research/notes/final_report_<vault_tag>.md
  - recommendations_path: research/runs/<vault_tag>/readability-recommendations.json

  RUN DIRECTIVES: append the FULL contents of research/runs/<vault_tag>/shims/polish.md here, verbatim.

  Write recommendations as a JSON array per the schema in your agent
  prompt. Cap at << p.readability_rec_cap >> recommendations, prioritized by impact.
```

## Step 16.2 — Read the recommendations

When the recommender returns:

1. **Read `research/runs/<vault_tag>/readability-recommendations.json`.**

2. **Read the recommender's report-back.** It tells you:
   - Total count of recommendations
   - Breakdown by category (merge-paragraphs, break-paragraph, make-list, make-table, bold-keyterms, split-sentence, remove-hr, add-whitespace)
   - Highest-severity issue
   - Expected net char delta if all applied

---

## Step 16.3 — Decide which to apply

You are not obligated to apply every recommendation. Use these heuristics:

**Apply confidently:**
- All `merge-paragraphs` recommendations where adjacent paragraphs are clearly the same sub-topic (rationale field confirms this)
- All `break-paragraph` recommendations on paragraphs > 800 CJK / 1500 EN chars
- All `remove-hr` recommendations (horizontal rules don't belong in research reports)
- All `add-whitespace` recommendations (zero risk)
- `make-table` recommendations when the prose-comparison passage cited 3+ entities × 2+ dimensions and the recommender's suggested table preserves all comparison points

**Apply with judgment:**
- `make-list` recommendations: confirm the prose was actually enumerative (3+ items in sequence) and not load-bearing argumentative prose. If the rationale says "items appear sequentially in flowing prose," that's NOT a list candidate — skip it.
- `bold-keyterms` recommendations: confirm the term is genuinely a key term, not just any noun. Bold load-bearing concepts and statistics; don't over-bold.

**Apply skeptically (often skip):**
- `split-sentence` recommendations on argumentative prose where sentence length serves emphasis or rhythm
- Recommendations that touch the opening thesis paragraph (load-bearing — keep as written)
- Recommendations that change tables that already exist

**Always skip:**
- Any recommendation whose `current` field doesn't match the actual draft (the recommender mis-anchored — log and ignore)
- Recommendations that would change H2 heading text
- Recommendations that delete substantive content (the recommender shouldn't, but verify)

---

## Step 16.4 — Apply chosen recommendations via Edit

For each recommendation you decide to apply:

1. Use the Edit tool on `research/notes/final_report_<vault_tag>.md`
2. `old_string` = the recommendation's `current` field (exactly as the recommender wrote it)
3. `new_string` = the recommendation's `recommended` field

**For non-ASCII text (CJK / Arabic / Cyrillic):** the recommender copied `current` verbatim from Read output. Trust that. Don't retype.

**Order of application:**
1. `remove-hr` first (smallest changes, cleanest baseline)
2. `merge-paragraphs` and `break-paragraph` (paragraph-level changes)
3. `make-list` and `make-table` (structural conversions)
4. `bold-keyterms` (within paragraphs that survived the merges/breaks)
5. `split-sentence` (within finalized paragraphs)
6. `add-whitespace` (final cleanup)

If an Edit fails because `old_string` doesn't match (recommender mis-anchored), skip that recommendation and continue with the rest.

---

## Step 16.5 — Log decisions

Write `research/runs/<vault_tag>/readability-decisions.json` with the orchestrator's decisions:

```json
{
  "total_recommendations": <int>,
  "applied": [<list of recommendation IDs you applied>],
  "skipped": [
    {"id": "rec-N", "reason": "<one sentence>"}
  ],
  "edit_failures": [
    {"id": "rec-N", "reason": "old_string did not match the draft"}
  ],
  "net_char_delta_actual": <int — measure the actual delta>
}
```

This is the audit trail. If a future review finds a readability problem we should have fixed, this log shows whether we considered it and skipped, or never saw the recommendation.

---

## Exit criterion

- `research/runs/<vault_tag>/readability-recommendations.json` exists
- `research/runs/<vault_tag>/readability-decisions.json` exists with at least one entry in `applied` or all `skipped`
- `research/notes/final_report_<vault_tag>.md` reflects the applied recommendations
- The final report's structure (H2 list, executive summary, conclusion) is unchanged from step 15's output (this step does not restructure)

---

## Pipeline complete

Return to the entry skill (`hyperresearch`). Mark all todos complete. Tell the user the final report path.

You're done.
