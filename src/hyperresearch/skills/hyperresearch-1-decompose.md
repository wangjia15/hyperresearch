description: >
  Step 1 of the hyperresearch V8 pipeline. Decomposes the canonical research
  query into atomic items, classifies pipeline_tier and response_format,
  and produces the coverage matrix that downstream steps depend on. The
  required_section_headings field this step produces is the single
  highest-leverage input for instruction-following scores. Invoked via
  Skill tool from the entry skill (hyperresearch).

# Step 1 — Prompt decomposition

**Tier gate:** Runs for ALL tiers. This step also classifies the tier itself.

**Goal:** before any research happens, decompose the user's prompt into its atomic items. This artifact is read by the instruction-critic in step 11 and by the draft sub-orchestrators in step 10 to make sure the pipeline doesn't drift from what was actually asked.

**Why this step exists:** the single dimension where the pipeline has the widest variance is whether the draft structurally mirrors the prompt. When the prompt asks "for each significant character, describe techniques / arcs / fate" and the draft produces per-character sections with those three fields in order — that's a structural match, high instruction-following. When the prompt asks the same thing and the draft organizes around thematic analysis — that's a structural mismatch, even if every fact is in there. The decomposition makes the structural requirement explicit, in writing, BEFORE drafting.

---

## Recover state

The orchestrator's bootstrap step (in the entry skill) has already produced:
- `research/runs/<vault_tag>/scaffold.md` — vault_tag, modality, wrapper requirements
- `research/runs/<vault_tag>/query.md` — canonical research query (GOSPEL)

Read both before starting. The vault_tag is in the scaffold's "Run config" section.

---

## Procedure

1. **Re-read the canonical research query** end to end (`research/runs/<vault_tag>/query.md`).

2. **Walk through it and extract every atomic item** — anything that's a discrete thing the prompt named. These fall into categories:
   - **Sub-questions** — explicit or implicit questions the draft must answer ("What cues influence this?" → atomic: "cues influencing X")
   - **Named entities / categories** — every character, product, company, concept, time period, etc. the prompt names by name
   - **Required formats** — "mind map", "ranked list", "FAQ", "tabular", "scenario matrix", etc.
   - **Required sections** — "include X section", "end with Y", "begin with Z"
   - **Time horizons** — forward-looking spans: "through 2027", "next 12 months", "historical through 2010-present"
   - **Time periods (historical, period-pinned)** — backward-looking specific reporting periods that have a primary-source filing somewhere: "Q3 2024", "FY 2023", "9 months ended September 30, 2024", "as of November 17, 2025", "March 2024 equity raise". Different from time_horizons. Extract every one — they drive period-targeted searches in step 2 and a primary-source-coverage check in step 8. **Failing to extract these is the #1 cause of "agent had the topic right but missed the rubric's exact figures"**: the answer lives in the period-pinned filing the agent never fetched (10-Q, 10-K, statutory accounts, regulatory disclosure).
   - **Scope conditions** — "for non-academic contexts", "under SIL-4 constraints"

3. **Produce `required_section_headings`.** This is the single highest-leverage field for instruction-following scores. Ordered array of literal H2 heading strings the draft MUST emit in order. **Never leave this array empty** — an empty heading contract means the drafter invents its own structure, which systematically scores lower on IF because it never matches the evaluator's structural expectations. Population rule:
   - If the prompt contains enumerated asks (regex `\b\d[.\)]` such as "1)", "1." or leading phrase "List X, Y, Z" / "cover the following:"), produce one entry per enumerated item, in prompt order, with the prompt's verbatim noun-phrase as the heading slug.
   - If the prompt names N entities in a list and asks to "discuss", "analyze", "describe", or "evaluate" each, produce one heading per entity.
   - **Otherwise (narrative prompts):** generate headings from the sub-questions you extracted in step 2. Each sub-question becomes one H2 heading, phrased as a declarative topic ("## 1. Historical Context and Evolution", "## 2. Key Mechanisms and Drivers", etc.). For open-ended prompts ("Write about X"), derive 4-7 headings from the topic's natural analytical structure: background/context → core analysis (1-3 sections mapped to sub-questions) → comparative analysis → implications/future outlook. The headings don't need to quote the prompt verbatim, but they MUST cover every sub-question from step 2.

   Example (prompt: "Your report should: 1) List major manufacturers... 2) Include images... 3) Analyze primary use cases... 4) Investigate market penetration..."):
   ```json
   "required_section_headings": [
     "## 1. Major Manufacturers, Device Models, and Configurations",
     "## 2. Images of Representative Devices",
     "## 3. Primary Use Cases and Deployment Scenarios",
     "## 4. Regional Market Analysis"
   ]
   ```

4. **Write `research/runs/<vault_tag>/prompt-decomposition.json`:**

```json
{
  "sub_questions": [
    "What is the specific question this addresses?",
    "..."
  ],
  "entities": [
    {"name": "Bronze Saints", "type": "category", "required_fields": ["techniques", "arcs", "fate"]}
  ],
  "required_formats": [
    "mind map of causal structure",
    "5-tier support/resistance table"
  ],
  "required_sections": [
    "## Opinionated Synthesis (if wrapper_contract demands it)"
  ],
  "required_section_headings": [
    "## 1. Major Manufacturers, Device Models, and Configurations",
    "## 2. Images of Representative Devices",
    "## 3. Primary Use Cases and Deployment Scenarios",
    "## 4. Regional Market Analysis"
  ],
  "time_horizons": ["2010-present", "12-month forward"],
  "time_periods": [
    {"period": "Q3 2024", "type": "fiscal-quarter", "primary_source": "10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024", "issuer": "ClearPoint Neuro"},
    {"period": "FY 2023", "type": "fiscal-year", "primary_source": "10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023", "issuer": "ClearPoint Neuro"},
    {"period": "March 2024", "type": "event-anchored", "primary_source": "8-K disclosure or press release for March 2024 equity raise", "issuer": "ClearPoint Neuro"}
  ],
  "scope_conditions": ["urban rail specifically, not mainline"],
  "pipeline_tier": "full",
  "response_format": "argumentative",
  "citation_style": "wikilink",
  "levers": {
    "register": "analyze",
    "register_confidence": "high",
    "domain_notes": "Sourcing: academic APIs first (arXiv, Nature); recency matters within 24 months for hardware claims; measured figures outrank vendor claims.",
    "inference_depth": "standard",
    "rationale": {"register": "query asks which approaches are most effective — evaluation-shaped", "inference_depth": "surface literature appears rich; revisit at loci analysis"}
  }
}
```

5. **Omit nothing the prompt names explicitly.** List every numbered ask, every named entity, every format cue as a separate atomic item, even if they feel redundant. The instruction-critic catches false-positive atomic items cheaply; it cannot catch false-negatives.

6. **Do NOT include wrapper-contract requirements here** — those live in `research/wrapper_contract.json` separately. The decomposition is ONLY about what the user's actual prompt named.

7. **Classify `pipeline_tier` and `response_format`.**

   **`pipeline_tier`** — how much pipeline to run:

   | Tier | When to use | Signal words / patterns |
   |------|-------------|------------------------|
   | `"light"` | Query has a clear, bounded answer. Factual lookup, definition, simple explanation, short how-to, list/catalog, quick comparison, landscape overview, multi-entity survey. | "What is...", "How do I...", "List the...", "Define...", "Overview of...", "Compare X and Y", short-to-moderate prompts, single clear question or 2–5 sub-questions |
   | `"full"` | Deep analysis, synthesis of conflicting evidence, defended thesis, literature review, forecast with evidence chains. | "Analyze the impact of...", "Evaluate whether...", multi-paragraph prompts, explicit request for depth/rigor, research-grade questions, contested topics |

   **Default is `"full"`.** When uncertain, tier up. Running the full pipeline on a simple query wastes money; running the light pipeline on a complex query produces a bad report.

   **`response_format`** — how the output is shaped:

   | Format | When to use | Characteristics |
   |--------|-------------|----------------|
   | `"short"` | Direct answer, not a report. | 500–2000 words. 1–5 paragraphs. Tables/lists as needed. No Opinionated Synthesis section. Thesis up front, evidence follows. |
   | `"structured"` | Coverage across entities/topics. Scannability matters more than argumentative density. | 2000–5000 words. Scannable subsections. Breadth-first. Tables, bullets, visual devices liberally. Survey-style coverage acceptable. |
   | `"argumentative"` | Defended thesis, deep analysis, evidence-chain reasoning. | 5000–10000 words. Dense thesis-driven prose. "ARGUE, DON'T JUST REPORT" fully active. Required Opinionated Synthesis with all subsections. |

   **The two dimensions are independent.** Most common pairings:
   - `light` + `short` — factual lookup, definition, simple how-to
   - `light` + `structured` — list/catalog, quick multi-entity comparison, landscape overview
   - `full` + `argumentative` — deep analysis, literature review, forecast (the current default)
   - `full` + `structured` — comprehensive survey where adversarial depth still matters

   **`citation_style`** — how the final report handles source attribution:

   | Style | When to use | Output |
   |-------|-------------|--------|
   | `"wikilink"` | **Default.** Personal use in a vault — every citation is a clickable wiki-link back to the raw source note in `research/notes/`. | `[[note-id]]` markers inline. No separate Sources section (each link self-resolves to the source note's frontmatter title + URL). |
   | `"inline"` | Public deliverable, benchmark wrappers, or verifiable research report for someone outside the vault. | `[N]` inline citations (grouped `[7, 12]` when one point cites several sources) + a formatted `## Sources` list at the end. |
   | `"none"` | Polished expert-analysis with no visible citation apparatus. | No citation markers, no Sources section. |

   **Wrapper override:** if `research/wrapper_contract.json` exists and specifies `citation_style`, it overrides the default. The benchmark harness sets `"inline"` via wrapper_contract so RACE evaluators can read numbered references; everything else gets the wikilink default.

   **`levers`** — run-time posture, auto-selected here and rendered into shim files that every downstream spawn receives. Three fields:

   **`register`** — the report's voice. Classify from the query's verb shape:

   | Register | Signal words / patterns |
   |----------|------------------------|
   | `"teach"` | "explain", "how does X work", "help me understand", "walk me through", "what is X and why" |
   | `"survey"` | "overview of", "survey", "landscape", "compile", "list the approaches", "what are the main X" — coverage-shaped, no verdict requested |
   | `"analyze"` | "evaluate", "assess", "compare and determine", "which is most effective", "feasibility of" — evaluation-shaped (the default) |
   | `"advocate"` | "should we", "argue for/against", "make the case", "recommend a course of action" |

   **Confidence rule:** set `register_confidence`. Deviate from `"analyze"` ONLY when the signal is strong (`"high"` confidence); ambiguous or mixed-signal queries get `"analyze"` with `"low"` confidence. A wrong register costs more than a default one.

   **Precedence:** an explicit user directive in the query ("make it a survey", "just teach me", "mode=teach") ALWAYS wins over your classification. If `research/wrapper_contract.json` has a `levers` key, it wins over classification but not over explicit user text.

   **`domain_notes`** — 2-3 freeform sentences: sourcing strategy for this topic (academic-first? primary documents? filings?), evidence norms (what counts as strong here), and the recency window that matters. Always write them; downstream research and drafting agents read them verbatim.

   **`inference_depth`** — `"surface"` (bounded question, authoritative consensus suffices), `"standard"` (default), or `"deep"` (the answer likely lives beyond the clear web: gray literature, filings, inference over absences). This is PROVISIONAL — step 4 re-evaluates it against the actual corpus and may upgrade it.

8. **Coverage matrix self-audit.** Re-read the verbatim query. Walk through it phrase by phrase and extract every **significant noun phrase, proper noun, technical term, and category name**. For each:
   - Does it map to at least one atomic item in the decomposition?
   - Is the decomposition's interpretation **as broad as the phrase's natural scope**? (e.g., "SaaS applications" must not be narrowed to "POS SaaS"; "rugged tablets" must not be collapsed into "payment terminals")
   - If the phrase has multiple plausible referents, does the decomposition cover BOTH readings?

   Write the matrix to `research/runs/<vault_tag>/temp/coverage-matrix.md`:

   ```markdown
   ## Coverage Matrix — query phrase → atomic item mapping

   | Query phrase (verbatim) | Mapped atomic item(s) | Scope check | Gap? |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | "rugged tablets" | Entity: rugged tablets | OK — full scope | No |
   | "SaaS applications" | Sub-Q3: SaaS deployment | NARROWED — decomposition says "POS SaaS" but query says "SaaS applications" broadly | **YES** |
   | "Southeast Asia" | Sub-Q4: Regional market — SEA | OK | No |
   ```

   **If any row has `Gap? = YES`:** go back and fix the decomposition. Add the missing atomic items, broaden the narrowed scope_conditions, or add missing entities. Then re-run the matrix until every row passes. Do NOT proceed with known gaps — they cascade into missing searches, missing sources, and missing draft sections.

9. **Update the scaffold.** Append a "Tier rationale" subsection to `research/runs/<vault_tag>/scaffold.md` with a 2-3 sentence justification for the tier classification.

10. **Render the lever shims:**

    ```bash
    $HPR levers render <vault_tag> -j
    ```

    This writes `research/runs/<vault_tag>/shims/{research,drafting,critics,polish}.md` from the levers block. Later steps paste these files VERBATIM into subagent spawn prompts — you never compose or edit shim text yourself. If the command errors on an enum value, fix the levers block in the decomposition and re-run it.

---

## Exit criterion

- `research/runs/<vault_tag>/prompt-decomposition.json` exists, is valid JSON, every atomic item traces to the research_query
- `pipeline_tier` + `response_format` + `citation_style` are all set, and the `levers` block is present (register, domain_notes, inference_depth)
- `$HPR levers render` succeeded — all four shim files exist under `research/runs/<vault_tag>/shims/`
- `research/runs/<vault_tag>/temp/coverage-matrix.md` exists with **zero `Gap? = YES` rows**
- `research/runs/<vault_tag>/scaffold.md` includes a Tier rationale subsection

---

## Next step

Return to the entry skill (`hyperresearch`). Read `research/runs/<vault_tag>/prompt-decomposition.json` to learn the tier, then invoke step 2:

```
<< h.load_skill("hyperresearch-2-width-sweep") >>
```

Step 2 runs for ALL tiers.
