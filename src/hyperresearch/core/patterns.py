# Match [[target]] and [[target|display text]].
#
# The trailing `(?!\()` rejects `[[Label]](https://url)` — a markdown link
# whose *label* happens to be bracketed, common on GitHub READMEs,
# awesome-lists and Wikipedia-style footnotes (`[[100]](…#cite_note-100)`).
# Without it every such label becomes a wiki-link target, sync writes it to
# the `links` table, and `repair` / `graph stub` mint a stub note for it. A
# real wiki-link is never immediately followed by `(`; a parenthetical
# after a space (`[[note]] (2024)`) still matches (issue #93).
#
# Neither character class admits `[`. Page bodies are attacker-controlled
# and this runs on every sync: with `[` allowed, a line of N `[` characters
# made every `[[` start position eat to the end of the run before failing —
# quadratic, ~20 s at 40 KB and unbounded at 1 MB. Excluding `[` makes a
# candidate fail at its first extra bracket, so scanning is linear. A target
# with an interior `[` (`[[t.IO[t.Any]]`) was already rejected downstream by
# is_valid_wiki_link_target's bracket-balance check; now it never matches.

# --- Code stripping before link extraction and indexing ---------------------
#
# Code must be removed before WIKI_LINK_RE runs: bash test syntax
# (`[[ -n "$k" ]]`) is lexically a wiki-link. This used to be two regexes,
# ```.*?``` and `[^`]+`, which closed every span at the first backtick run
# of any length. The builtin provider (#129) fences code with a run longer
# than any inside it, as CommonMark requires, so code holding an odd number
# of ``` ended the block early and leaked its [[ ]] into the parser (#140).
#
# The rules follow CommonMark where it matters here:
#
# - A fenced block opens on a line whose first non-blank characters are 3+
#   backticks with no backtick after them, and closes on a line holding
#   only a run of AT LEAST that many backticks. An opener with no such line
#   after it is literal text, not a block to the end of the note: CommonMark
#   would run it to the end, but a prose line that happens to start with ```
#   would then drop the rest of the note from links and search. The builtin
#   provider always closes its fences, so #140 does not depend on the
#   unclosed case. Any indentation is accepted (fences inside list items).
#   Tilde fences are not recognised, as before.
# - An inline span opened by N backticks closes at the next run of EXACTLY
#   N backticks; an unmatched run is literal text. Spans may cross lines,
#   as the old regex allowed. Backtick runs that are not fences (mid-line
#   ```x```, a line-start run followed by more backticks) are inline runs.
#
# Fetched bodies are attacker-controlled and this runs on every sync, so
# it is a scanner, not a regex: a backreference regex re-scans to the end
# of the text for every unclosed run and goes superlinear on backtick
# floods. Both passes below are linear.
#
# Stripped code is replaced by the newlines it held (a space for a span
# on one line), so sync's per-line link numbers stay true and text on
# either side of a span cannot fuse into a new `[[`.
