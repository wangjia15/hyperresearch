"""Escalation queue — blocked fetches become browser-lane work, not losses.

Pre-4.0, a URL that hit a login wall, bot block, or junk gate was discarded;
at dissertation scale that's dozens of silently lost sources per run. Now the
fetch engine ENQUEUES the blocked URL here, and the `hyperresearch-
browser-fetcher` agent drains the queue by driving the user's real Chrome
browser through whatever lane the harness has (Claude-in-Chrome on Claude
Code, the `eval` tool's relay browser on OMP) — one tab at a time, serial,
precious. On a harness with no browser lane the queue accumulates instead,
which is still strictly better than discarding the URL.

The queue lives in the vault DB (`escalations` table) rather than a JSON
file: parallel fetcher waves enqueue concurrently, and SQLite gives atomic
claim semantics for free.

Lifecycle:  queued → in_progress → fetched | needs_human | abandoned
`needs_human` is the HARD scope boundary: CAPTCHAs, 2FA, and logins are
consolidated into one prompt for the human — never solved automatically.
