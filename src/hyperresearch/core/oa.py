"""Open-access full-text recovery — Unpaywall + Europe PMC + CORE.

A paywalled paper otherwise enters the vault as an abstract. `extract_doi`
already stamps `doi:` on every fetched note, the junk gate passes a publisher
landing page (an abstract is not junk), and downstream investigators then
reason over ~1-3k characters while the report cites the work as though the
paper had been read.

This module closes that gap. Given a DOI, it asks three free APIs whether a
legal open-access copy exists and, if so, refetches from there. Two entry
points: `recover_full_text` replaces a thin result (an abstract), and
`rescue_full_text` handles the case where the source could not be read at all
— a 403, a login wall, a bot wall — where the paper is most completely lost and
an open-access copy is most likely to exist. The APIs, in the order tried:

1. **Unpaywall** (`api.unpaywall.org`) — broad coverage, but their terms want a
   real contact address, so it is SKIPPED unless `[scholar] contact_email` is
   set. Shipping one shared placeholder across every install is how that
   placeholder gets rate-limited for everybody.
2. **Europe PMC** (`www.ebi.ac.uk`) — no key, no email, biomedical only.
3. **CORE** (`api.core.ac.uk`) — the largest open-access aggregator, and the
   only one of the three that HOSTS the text rather than pointing at a copy
   somewhere else: a CORE work carries its own plain-text body and a
   CORE-served PDF. Needs a key in `CORE_API_KEY`; SKIPPED silently without
   one, exactly as Unpaywall is skipped without an email.

Unpaywall and Europe PMC go first because they know which *version* a copy is
— Unpaywall labels every location, and Europe PMC only serves the version of
record. CORE does not say, so a CORE recovery is recorded as unknown-version
and the banner tells the reader to check quotations. That makes CORE the broad
net behind the two authoritative resolvers rather than a replacement for them.

So the feature degrades cleanly: with no configuration at all it still recovers
biomedical literature; an email widens it to everything Unpaywall indexes; a
CORE key widens it to everything CORE has harvested, which is most of what
sits in institutional repositories outside biomedicine.

INVARIANTS
----------
* **Recovery can never fail a fetch.** Every error path leaves the caller
  exactly where it was, because the abstract you already have beats no note at
  all — and a failed fetch that rescue cannot help still fails as it always did.
  Rescue only ever turns a failure into a note, never the reverse.
* **Recovery never shrinks a note.** If the recovered copy extracts to less
  text than the landing page, the landing page wins.
* **The swap is always disclosed** — in the note body (a blockquote banner), in
  the `oa_*` frontmatter fields, and in the CLI/JSON output. A reader must
  never have to guess that the bytes came from somewhere other than `source:`.
  A rescued note says so even more loudly, because for those NOTHING came from
  `source:` — not the body, not the title, not the authors.
* **Resolved URLs are attacker-influenceable** (they arrive inside a
  third-party API response) and are therefore gated by `check_oa_url` before
  anything fetches them.

Unpaywall and Europe PMC lookups go through `scholar._fetch_json`; CORE needs
a bearer header, which that layer cannot send, so it goes through
`hyperresearch.scholar.base.fetch_json` instead. Both land in the `api_cache`
table, so re-running a vault is cheap and offline-friendly. A resolver that
is rate-limited (`scholar.RateLimitedError`) is treated as "no OA copy" here
— OA recovery is best-effort and must never abort a fetch. Tests monkeypatch
`scholar._http_get_json` and `scholar.base._http_get`; no test here hits the
network.
