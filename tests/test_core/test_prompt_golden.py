"""Golden tests: rendering the shipped templates with the `full` profile must
reproduce the pre-templating prompt content byte-for-byte.

The golden fixtures under tests/fixtures/golden_prompts/ were snapshotted from
the 1.x (pre-template) prompt sources. Any numeric drift between the built-in
profiles and the templates shows up here as a diff — changing a profile value
or template deliberately requires updating the golden, which makes prompt
changes reviewable instead of silent.

Deliberate deviations already folded into the goldens (2026-07-19):
  - Untrusted-source policy (2026-07-20): RESEARCHER_AGENT and
    DEPTH_INVESTIGATOR_AGENT gained the "Untrusted content policy" block
    (fetched note bodies arrive fenced in <untrusted-source> delimiters and
    must be treated as data, not instructions).
  - width-sweep: the three inconsistent full-tier source-target statements
    (40-100 / 40–80 / 55–80) were unified to the profile value 55–80; the
    light target 12–20 was unified to the table value 15–25; the tier table's
    full fetchers-per-wave 8–12 was unified to the Wave-1 value 10–12.
  - Phase-2 source-ranking additions (2026-07-19): width-sweep gained the
    utility-scores-travel-with-URLs rule and step 2.7 (persist ranking
    signals: claims ingest / backfill-doi / sources score / graph rank);
    triple-draft 10.2 gained ranked-curation via `search --ranked`; the
    fetcher agent gained the `--utility-score` pass-through section.
  - Phase-3 per-run workspaces (2026-07-19): every run-scoped artifact path
    moved from flat research/ to research/runs/<vault_tag>/ (query file is
    now runs/<tag>/query.md) across ALL skills and agent prompts; the router
    gained bootstrap step 2.5 (`hpr run init`), manifest-first recovery, and
    the dissertation tier row + step 1.5 (chapter partition).
  - Phase-4 browser lane (2026-07-19): width-sweep gained step 2.8 (drain
    the escalation queue via ONE browser-fetcher; consolidated needs_human
    prompt; run block --on human-challenges for non-interactive runs); the
    router gained the "Browser-lane escalations" section; new
    BROWSER_FETCHER_AGENT golden.
  - Phase-5 verification (2026-07-19): router tier sequences gained step
    14.5 (cite-check) and the final gate gained `run verify`, the
    retraction sweep, and the three verification lint rules; new
    CITE_CHECKER_AGENT golden.
  - Scale gears (2026-07-19): the router gained the "Scale gear (tier ≠
    gear)" section (full vs premier, `profile use`), premier in the run-init
    profile list, and a gear-aware frontmatter description; width-sweep's
    diminishing-returns note now cites the gear ceiling instead of the
    hardcoded "~65 reference / beyond ~80" full-scale prose. The `full.*`
    template refs that meant "the installed scale" became `p.*` — byte-
    identical under the default gear (verified by these goldens), truthful
    under `premier`.
  - ModelMap wiring + dollar-cost removal (2026-07-19): every agent's
    `model:` frontmatter line became `<< p.models.X >>` (rendered from the
    profile's ModelMap — same values under `full`, but now overridable, e.g.
    a haiku fetcher); "Runs on Sonnet/Opus" claims left descriptions and
    prose so a model override can't be contradicted by stale text; dollar
    figures were removed repo-wide (the router tier table lost its cost
    column, gap-fetch's "+$1-3 per run" became fetcher-count overhead
    framing, the source-analyst's "$2-5 per spawn" block became "Effort
    discipline", and its Sonnet-1M context claims became model-neutral).
  - Ship-gate enforcement (2026-07-19, after bench Q62 shipped a 25.6K-word
    report with 24 hallucinated-quote lint errors "assessed as false
    positives"): the router's final gate now centers on `run finish` (verify
    + manifest flip, no-override language, bounded fix loop) instead of the
    advisory verify+lint checklist, and invariant 14 makes `passed: true`
    the only definition of complete.
  - Report register + calm citations (2026-07-20, after the Q62 four-report
    comparison showed the judge's only consistent losses were pedagogy and
    readability): the instruction critic gained check R5 (section primers)
    and R2 now counts grouped citation markers (`[7, 12]` = two citations).
    The synthesizer and polish auditor (not golden-covered) gained the
    primer requirement, the calm citation style (grouped brackets, sentence-
    end placement, run consolidation with number-bearing anchors kept), and
    register discipline (meta-discourse ban, hedging discipline, kicker
    rationing) distilled from the humanize-ai-text skill.
  - Run levers (2026-07-20): step 1 now auto-selects register / domain
    notes / inference depth and renders them to shim files via `hpr levers
    render`; the router's spawn contract gained item 4 (paste the role's
    shim verbatim) and invariant 15; every spawning skill's spawn template
    gained a RUN DIRECTIVES paste line (research/drafting/critics/polish
    roles); every shim-receiving agent gained a Run-directives acceptance
    paragraph; the dialectic and instruction critics gained
    register-conditional standards. The cite-checker and
    9-evidence-digest are deliberately untouched (no shim: verification
    is register-independent; step 9 spawns nothing).
  - Coverage before elegance (2026-07-22, after the Q52 rerun scored below
    baseline on comprehensiveness and insight by trading the systematic
    comparison surface and a developed factor decomposition for a cleaner
    thesis, at the same word count): the depth critic gained a shallow-spot
    bullet for developed quantitative mechanisms compressed to a bare mention
    (the highest-insight loss), and the instruction critic gained check R6
    (comparison-axis coverage, register-independent). The synthesizer (not
    golden-covered) gained pass-1 item 12 (coverage and mechanism depth are
    load-bearing content), a reframed selectivity paragraph (select sources,
    not points), and a "never cut a point to hit the ceiling" clause.
  - Profile constants authored once (2026-09-11, #101): step 4 and the
    loci-analyst agent became generic over `p.loci_analysts` / `p.loci_max`
    ("both Task calls", `loci-a.json`/`loci-b.json`, "exceeds 6" were
    hardcoded next to the templated count and broke on premier's 3
    analysts); triple-draft's CJK char column now renders
    `p.char_targets_no_word_boundary` (argumentative 20000–25000 became
    15000–30000, the 3-chars-per-word ratio every other format already
    used); the instruction critic's density trigger, the synthesizer's
    citation totals + floor, the draft orchestrator's word targets, and
    the width-sweep utility-scoring gate + vault-check interval all render
    from the profile — byte-identical under `full`.
  - Script-neutral citation density (2026-09-11, #76): the instruction
    critic's R2 (and the synthesizer, not golden-covered) count words —
    characters / `p.chars_per_word_no_word_boundary` for scripts without
    word boundaries — against `p.citation_density_min` per 1000 WORDS (9,
    the old 1.5-per-1000-characters floor expressed in English words)
    instead of per 1000 characters.
  - Multi-harness install (2026-09-12): prompts render for a target harness
    (`h` in the template context — see core/harnesses.py), so every
    Claude-Code-specific mechanic became harness-driven: tool names
    (`h.tools(...)`, `h.tool(...)`), the `model:` line (`h.model_line(...)`),
    skill loading (`h.load_skill(...)`), the spawn key (`h.spawn_key`), and
    install paths (`h.skill_rel(...)`). Under the default `claude` harness
    every one of those renders the previous bytes, so the goldens below still
    pin Claude Code's rendering. Two goldens changed on purpose: the entry
    skill gained a "This copy runs on <harness>" section (start command,
    skill-load form, spawn syntax, wave fan-out, and the degradations of
    harnesses without a browser lane or web-search tool) and its `Skill`
    tool / todo-list prose became harness-conditional; width-sweep's
    escalation-drain fallback now says "If the browser lane is unavailable"
    instead of naming the Claude-in-Chrome extension, because the same
    sentence must be true on OMP.
